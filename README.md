# Take a Poem

This world is so full of data lately 📊. Our jobs and routines require us to be so recional all the time, right? 

Well, it's the same with me. But as a teenager, I used to wrote a lot of **poems** ✍🏻 (I actually wanted to be a professor back then) on my Google Keep app.

Sooo, I found them these days on my phone and decide to make a little dual project 📜.

Welcome to the repository where you can **take a look on how I code and also Take a Poem** to espace from the routine 😄
